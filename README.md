# Liquid Music

## Introduction
Liquid Music is an integrated music streaming platform that combines both music streaming and playback services.

### Music Streaming Service:
A platform where artists upload their work and users can access their tracks within the framework of the service upon purchasing subscriptions. Part of the subscription revenue will go to the artists.
